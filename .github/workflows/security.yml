# Security Workflow for VS Code Extension Security Scanner
# Comprehensive security scanning on every commit and weekly schedule
#
# Tools Integrated (Phase 1):
# - Bandit: AST-based Python security scanning
# - Safety: Dependency vulnerability scanning
# - pip-audit: PyPI package auditing
# - Security Tests: Custom SQLite and validation tests
#
# Triggers:
# - Push to main/master/develop branches
# - Push to claude/** branches (Claude Code branches)
# - Pull requests to main/master/develop
# - Weekly schedule (Monday 00:00 UTC)
