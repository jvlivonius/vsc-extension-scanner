## ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP - Read This First

**For security vulnerabilities, please DO NOT use public GitHub issues!**

Instead, use GitHub Security Advisories for responsible disclosure:
üëâ https://github.com/jvlivonius/vsc-extension-scanner/security/advisories/new

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ Private disclosure to maintainer only
- ‚úÖ Coordinated fix development
- ‚úÖ Responsible public disclosure after fix
- ‚úÖ Credit for discovery (if desired)

## When to Use This Template

**Only use this public issue template for:**
- Security enhancement suggestions (not vulnerabilities)
- Non-critical security improvements
- Security tooling discussions
- Questions about security features
