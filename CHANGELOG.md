## [Unreleased]

## [3.5.0] - 2025-10-26

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES
- **Removed `--parallel` flag**: Parallel processing is now always used (no flag needed)
- **Removed `parallel` config setting**: Remove `parallel = true/false` from `~/.vscanrc`
- **Default behavior changed**: Now uses 3 workers automatically (4.88x speedup by default)
- **Sequential mode**: Use `--workers 1` instead of omitting `--parallel`

### Changed
- ThreadPoolExecutor now always used with configurable workers (1-5, default: 3)
- `--workers` parameter: Range changed from 2-5 to 1-5
- Workers=1 provides sequential behavior via ThreadPoolExecutor
- Unified scan implementation: Removed duplicate sequential code path (~100 lines eliminated)

### Removed
- `--parallel` CLI flag (breaking change)
- `parallel` configuration setting (breaking change)
- Sequential `_scan_extensions()` function (internal API)

### Migration Guide

**Old Commands (v3.4.0):**
```bash
vscan scan                  # Sequential (slow)
vscan scan --parallel       # 3 workers (fast)
vscan scan --parallel --workers 5  # 5 workers
```

**New Commands (v3.5.0):**
```bash
vscan scan                  # 3 workers (fast) - NEW DEFAULT!
vscan scan --workers 1      # Sequential (if needed)
vscan scan --workers 5      # 5 workers
```

**Configuration File:**
- **Remove**: `parallel = true/false` from `[scan]` section
- **Keep**: `workers = 3` (or any value 1-5)

**Action Required:**
1. Remove `--parallel` flag from all scripts
2. Remove `parallel = true/false` from `~/.vscanrc`
3. For sequential behavior: use `--workers 1`

### Benefits
- âœ… Single code path eliminates maintenance burden
- âœ… Performance by default (3 workers = 4.88x speedup)
- âœ… Simpler API (one concept: workers, not two: parallel + workers)
- âœ… Eliminates code duplication (~100 lines removed)
- âœ… Solves v3.4.1 roadmap Task 1 (code duplication)
- âœ… Solves v3.4.1 roadmap Task 6 (progress display duplication)

## [3.4.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- Parallel scanning feature with `--parallel` flag for 2-5x performance improvement
- `--workers` CLI option to configure worker count (2-5, default: 3)
- Configuration file support for parallel scanning settings (`scan.parallel`, `scan.workers`)
- Thread-safe parallel implementation using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Worker count displayed in progress indicators (both Rich and plain modes)

### Changed
- Performance: 4.88x speedup with 3 workers (validated via PoC with 30 extensions)
- Real-world impact: 66 extensions reduced from 6 minutes to 1.2 minutes
- Near-linear scaling up to 3 workers with 100% success rate

### Fixed
- SQLite thread safety: Implemented main-thread-only cache writes to prevent cross-thread connection errors
- Batch cache writes after parallel workers complete (prevents database lock issues)

### Performance
- 3 workers: 4.88x speedup, 100% success rate (recommended default)
- 5 workers: 4.27x speedup, 96.7% success rate (advanced users)
- No rate limiting detected from vscan.dev API (tested up to 7 workers)

## [3.3.3] - 2025-10-25
