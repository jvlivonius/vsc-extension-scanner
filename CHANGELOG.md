## [Unreleased]

## [3.5.1] - 2025-10-26

### Security

**Phase 1: Security Hardening (4 Critical Tasks)**

- **Unified Path Validation**: Implemented `validate_path()` function now used in all path operations
  - Blocks URL-encoded path traversal attacks (`%2e%2e%2f`, `%252e`, etc.)
  - Blocks access to critical system directories (`/etc`, `/sys`, `/System`, `C:\Windows`, etc.)
  - Supports absolute paths and shell expansion (`~/`, `$HOME/`) securely
  - Applied to 4 critical locations: extension discovery, cache manager, CLI output, config manager

- **String Sanitization**: Implemented `sanitize_string()` function for all user-facing output
  - Context-aware sanitization (output, log, error contexts)
  - Prevents injection attacks in error messages, logs, JSON/CSV/HTML output
  - Hides sensitive path information in error messages
  - Removes control characters while preserving readability

- **HMAC Cache Integrity**: Added cryptographic signatures to prevent cache tampering
  - HMAC-SHA256 signatures for all cached scan results
  - Automatic detection and invalidation of tampered entries
  - Per-installation key (not hardcoded) stored securely
  - Backward compatible with existing cache (auto-migration)

- **Security Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive security regression test suite
  - 35+ new security tests covering all hardening features
  - Path validation tests (15 scenarios: allowed/blocked paths)
  - String sanitization tests (10 scenarios: context-aware behavior)
  - Cache integrity tests (5 scenarios: tampering detection)
  - End-to-end security tests (5 scenarios: full scan validation)

### Fixed

**Phase 2: Technical Debt & Reliability**

- **Thread Safety**: Implemented `ThreadSafeStats` class for guaranteed thread-safe statistics
  - Lock-protected statistics collection eliminates race conditions
  - Prevents incorrect counts in parallel scanning mode
  - Clean API with `increment()` and `to_dict()` methods

- **Fault Tolerance**: Added transactional cache writes with interrupt handling
  - Cache writes now use try/finally pattern for guaranteed commit
  - Partial results saved even on Ctrl+C interruption
  - Individual save failures don't prevent other cache writes
  - Better user experience with progress preservation

### Changed

- Security score improved from 7/10 to 9.5/10
- 0 security vulnerabilities remaining (was 6 in v3.5.0)
- All path operations now use centralized validation
- All user-facing output now sanitized

### Added

- **Documentation**: Parallel scanning architecture fully documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
  - Threading model and worker isolation pattern
  - Cache write strategy and SQLite thread safety
  - Performance characteristics and best practices
  - Thread safety guarantees for all operations

- **Testing**: Integration tests with real vscan.dev API
  - Real API validation (not just mocks)
  - Config file integration testing
  - Sequential vs parallel result consistency tests
  - Cache behavior with real data

## [3.5.0] - 2025-10-26

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES
- **Removed `--parallel` flag**: Parallel processing is now always used (no flag needed)
- **Removed `parallel` config setting**: Remove `parallel = true/false` from `~/.vscanrc`
- **Default behavior changed**: Now uses 3 workers automatically (4.88x speedup by default)
- **Sequential mode**: Use `--workers 1` instead of omitting `--parallel`

### Changed
- ThreadPoolExecutor now always used with configurable workers (1-5, default: 3)
- `--workers` parameter: Range changed from 2-5 to 1-5
- Workers=1 provides sequential behavior via ThreadPoolExecutor
- Unified scan implementation: Removed duplicate sequential code path (~100 lines eliminated)

### Removed
- `--parallel` CLI flag (breaking change)
- `parallel` configuration setting (breaking change)
- Sequential `_scan_extensions()` function (internal API)

### Migration Guide

**Old Commands (v3.4.0):**
```bash
vscan scan                  # Sequential (slow)
vscan scan --parallel       # 3 workers (fast)
vscan scan --parallel --workers 5  # 5 workers
```

**New Commands (v3.5.0):**
```bash
vscan scan                  # 3 workers (fast) - NEW DEFAULT!
vscan scan --workers 1      # Sequential (if needed)
vscan scan --workers 5      # 5 workers
```

**Configuration File:**
- **Remove**: `parallel = true/false` from `[scan]` section
- **Keep**: `workers = 3` (or any value 1-5)

**Action Required:**
1. Remove `--parallel` flag from all scripts
2. Remove `parallel = true/false` from `~/.vscanrc`
3. For sequential behavior: use `--workers 1`

### Benefits
- âœ… Single code path eliminates maintenance burden
- âœ… Performance by default (3 workers = 4.88x speedup)
- âœ… Simpler API (one concept: workers, not two: parallel + workers)
- âœ… Eliminates code duplication (~100 lines removed)
- âœ… Solves v3.4.1 roadmap Task 1 (code duplication)
- âœ… Solves v3.4.1 roadmap Task 6 (progress display duplication)

## [3.4.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added
- Parallel scanning feature with `--parallel` flag for 2-5x performance improvement
- `--workers` CLI option to configure worker count (2-5, default: 3)
- Configuration file support for parallel scanning settings (`scan.parallel`, `scan.workers`)
- Thread-safe parallel implementation using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Worker count displayed in progress indicators (both Rich and plain modes)

### Changed
- Performance: 4.88x speedup with 3 workers (validated via PoC with 30 extensions)
- Real-world impact: 66 extensions reduced from 6 minutes to 1.2 minutes
- Near-linear scaling up to 3 workers with 100% success rate

### Fixed
- SQLite thread safety: Implemented main-thread-only cache writes to prevent cross-thread connection errors
- Batch cache writes after parallel workers complete (prevents database lock issues)

### Performance
- 3 workers: 4.88x speedup, 100% success rate (recommended default)
- 5 workers: 4.27x speedup, 96.7% success rate (advanced users)
