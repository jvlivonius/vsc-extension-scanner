## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Database Integrity Checks (Step 1)

**Commit:** `c15e6c9`

Implemented automatic SQLite database corruption detection and recovery:

**Features:**
- `_verify_database_integrity()` method using `PRAGMA integrity_check`
- `_handle_corrupted_database()` for automatic recovery
- Corrupted databases backed up with timestamps (e.g., `cache.db.corrupted.20251023_204805`)
- Fresh database created automatically on corruption detection
- No user intervention required

**Files Modified:**
- `cache_manager.py` (+60 lines)

**Tests Added:**
- `tests/test_db_integrity.py` (175 lines, 3 tests)
  - Normal database integrity validation
  - Corrupted database detection and recovery
  - Invalid SQLite header handling

**Benefits:**
- Prevents data loss from corrupted databases
- Automatic recovery without user intervention
- Clear logging and error messages
- Comprehensive test coverage

---

### 2. Comprehensive Integration Tests (Step 4)

**Commit:** `ac0f340`

Created comprehensive integration test suite covering all major workflows:

**Test Coverage (7 test suites):**

1. **Full Scan Workflow**
   - Extension discovery
   - Mock API scanning
   - Cache integration
   - JSON output generation
   - Output validation

2. **Cache Hit Workflow**
   - Pre-populated cache verification
   - Zero API calls confirmation
   - Cache statistics validation
   - Cache metadata verification

3. **Cache Miss and Save Workflow**
   - Cache miss detection
   - API call triggering
   - Result caching
   - Subsequent cache hit verification

4. **Output Mode Formatting**
   - Standard vs detailed mode comparison
   - Field inclusion/exclusion verification
   - JSON validation for both modes

5. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid extensions directory
   - Malformed package.json files
   - Failed scan result handling
   - Cache error resilience

6. **Cache Cleanup Operations**
   - Multiple entry creation
   - Clear cache operation
   - Empty cache verification

7. **Extension Metadata Parsing**
   - Full metadata extraction
   - Field accuracy verification

**Files Added:**
- `tests/test_integration.py` (529 lines)

**Features:**
- Mock vscan.dev API for reliable testing
- Mock extension directories for isolation
- Temporary directories for clean test isolation
- Validates all major features
- 100% test pass rate

**Benefits:**
- Comprehensive workflow testing
- No dependency on external services
- Fast and reliable test execution
- Easy to maintain and extend

---

### 3. Documentation Updates (Step 5)

**Commit:** `61750b4`

Updated all project documentation to reflect Phase 3 improvements:

**Files Created:**
- `PHASE3_REVIEW.md` (240 lines)
  - Comprehensive implementation summary
  - Test results and coverage
  - Quality assurance metrics
  - Backward compatibility verification

**Files Updated:**
- `CLAUDE.md`
  - Added Phase 3 improvements to current status
  - Updated testing commands section
  - Added database integrity and integration test features

- `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
  - Added Phase 3 Improvement Plan section
  - Updated overall progress chart
  - Implementation highlights
  - Quality metrics
  - New test commands

**Benefits:**
- Clear documentation of improvements
- Easy onboarding for new contributors
- Comprehensive test coverage documentation
- Updated project status tracking

## ⏭️ Intentionally Skipped Steps

### Step 2: Reduce Response Size Limits (1h)
**Reason:** Not critical for current use case
- MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE of 10MB is acceptable
- No performance issues observed
- Can be implemented later if needed

### Step 3: Create Troubleshooting Guide (2h)
**Reason:** User requested to skip
- Can be added in future iteration
- Current error messages are adequate
- Documentation exists in other forms
