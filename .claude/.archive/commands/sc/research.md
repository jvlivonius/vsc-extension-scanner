# /sc:research - Deep Research Command

> **Context Framework Note**: This command activates comprehensive research capabilities with adaptive planning, multi-hop reasoning, and evidence-based synthesis.

## ⚠️ Python CLI Optimization Notice

This command is optimized for **Python CLI development research**:

**✅ Available Tools:**
- Sequential MCP (multi-step reasoning)
- Serena MCP (session persistence)
- Context7 MCP (Python library docs)
- WebSearch (native - simple queries)
- WebFetch (native - single URLs)

**⚠️ Archived (Limited Functionality):**
- Tavily MCP - Advanced multi-source search
- Playwright MCP - Complex content extraction

**Best Use Cases:**
- ✅ Python library research (Context7)
- ✅ Technical documentation lookup
- ✅ Best practices and patterns
- ⚠️ Limited: Multi-source investigations

<!-- ORIGINAL CONFIGURATION (Archived):
mcp-servers: [tavily, sequential, playwright, serena]
Full multi-source research with Tavily advanced search and Playwright extraction
-->

## Triggers
- Research questions beyond knowledge cutoff
- Complex research questions
- Current events and real-time information
- Academic or technical research requirements
- Market analysis and competitive intelligence

## Context Trigger Pattern
```
/sc:research "[query]" [--depth quick|standard|deep|exhaustive] [--strategy planning|intent|unified]
```

## Behavioral Flow

### 1. Understand (5-10% effort)
- Assess query complexity and ambiguity
- Identify required information types
- Determine resource requirements
- Define success criteria

### 2. Plan (10-15% effort)
- Select planning strategy based on complexity
- Identify parallelization opportunities
- Generate research question decomposition
- Create investigation milestones

### 3. TodoWrite (5% effort)
- Create adaptive task hierarchy
- Scale tasks to query complexity (3-15 tasks)
- Establish task dependencies
- Set progress tracking

### 4. Execute (50-60% effort)
- **Parallel-first searches**: Always batch similar queries
- **Smart extraction**: Route by content complexity
- **Multi-hop exploration**: Follow entity and concept chains
- **Evidence collection**: Track sources and confidence

### 5. Track (Continuous)
- Monitor TodoWrite progress
- Update confidence scores
- Log successful patterns
- Identify information gaps

### 6. Validate (10-15% effort)
- Verify evidence chains
- Check source credibility
- Resolve contradictions
- Ensure completeness

## Key Patterns

### Parallel Execution
- Batch all independent searches
- Run concurrent extractions
- Only sequential for dependencies

### Evidence Management
- Track search results
- Provide clear citations when available
- Note uncertainties explicitly

### Adaptive Depth
- **Quick**: Basic search, 1 hop, summary output
- **Standard**: Extended search, 2-3 hops, structured report
- **Deep**: Comprehensive search, 3-4 hops, detailed analysis
- **Exhaustive**: Maximum depth, 5 hops, complete investigation

## MCP Integration (Python CLI Optimized)
- **Sequential MCP**: Complex reasoning and synthesis ✅
- **Serena MCP**: Research session persistence ✅
- **Context7 MCP**: Python library documentation ✅
- **WebSearch** (native): Simple web queries ✅
- **WebFetch** (native): Single URL extraction ✅

<!-- ARCHIVED MCP INTEGRATION:
- Tavily: Primary search and extraction engine (archived - multi-source research)
- Playwright: JavaScript-heavy content extraction (archived - browser automation)
-->

## Output Standards
- Save reports to `claudedocs/research_[topic]_[timestamp].md`
- Include executive summary
- Provide confidence levels
- List all sources with citations

## Examples
```
/sc:research "latest developments in quantum computing 2024"
/sc:research "competitive analysis of AI coding assistants" --depth deep
/sc:research "best practices for distributed systems" --strategy unified
```

## Boundaries
**Will**: Current information, intelligent search, evidence-based analysis
**Won't**: Make claims without sources, skip validation, access restricted content
