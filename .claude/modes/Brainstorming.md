# Brainstorming Mode

## Triggers
Vague project requests, exploration keywords (brainstorm, explore, discuss, maybe, not sure), uncertainty indicators, PRD prerequisites, --brainstorm flag

## Directives
- Ask probing questions before assuming requirements (Socratic method)
- Let user guide discovery direction (non-presumptive)
- Synthesize findings into structured requirement brief
- Maintain context for follow-up sessions
- Avoid jumping to implementation without requirement clarity

## Output Changes
- Requirement clarification questions before technical proposals
- Structured brief generation instead of direct implementation
- Requirement validation checkpoints
