# Session Checkpoint - 2025-10-27

## Session Activity
Successfully executed `/sc:load` command with complete project onboarding.

## Actions Completed
1. **Project Activation**: Activated vsc-extension-scanner project with Serena MCP
2. **Onboarding**: Created 7 comprehensive memory files for project context
3. **Documentation Review**: Analyzed README.md, CLAUDE.md, setup.py, pyproject.toml
4. **Structure Analysis**: Mapped codebase organization and test suite

## Memory Files Created
1. `project_purpose` - Project identity, goals, and current status
2. `tech_stack` - Complete technology stack and dependencies
3. `code_style_conventions` - Naming conventions, architecture constraints, security patterns
4. `suggested_commands` - Development workflow commands (testing, building, git)
5. `task_completion_checklist` - Pre-commit validation checklist
6. `codebase_structure` - Directory organization and file responsibilities
7. `important_guidelines` - Critical documentation, security patterns, design principles

## Project Context Loaded
- **Version**: v3.5.1 (Production Ready)
- **Status**: All v3.5.1 tasks complete (security hardening + technical debt)
- **Quality**: 161+ tests, 100% passing, 85% coverage
- **Architecture**: 3-layer strict (Presentation → Application → Infrastructure)
- **Security**: HMAC cache integrity, path validation, string sanitization

## Ready for Development
Project context fully loaded and persisted. All critical patterns, constraints, and workflows documented in Serena memory for cross-session continuity.

## Next Session
Use `/sc:load` to restore full project context. All memories available for quick reference.
