5. ‚úÖ Follow [Development Setup](#development-setup) below
6. ‚úÖ Make your first contribution!

**Estimated time:** 30-45 minutes for initial setup and reading

---

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork and Clone (5 minutes)

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub (click "Fork" button), then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vsc-extension-scanner.git
cd vsc-extension-scanner

# Add upstream remote to sync with main repository
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jvlivonius/vsc-extension-scanner.git
```

**‚úÖ Verify:** Run `git remote -v` - you should see both `origin` (your fork) and `upstream` (main repo)

### 2. Install Development Dependencies (3-5 minutes)

```bash
# Install package in editable mode with development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev,test]

# Install pre-commit hooks (runs security checks automatically before each commit)
pre-commit install
```

**‚úÖ Expected output:**
```
Successfully installed vscode-scanner ...
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### 3. Verify Setup (2-3 minutes)

```bash
# Run all tests to verify everything works
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# ‚úÖ Expected output:
# ======================== test session starts ========================
# collected 628 items
# tests/test_security.py::test_path_validation PASSED          [ 1%]
# ...
# ======================== 628 passed in 45.2s ========================
```

```bash
# Run security checks
pre-commit run --all-files

# ‚úÖ Expected: All checks pass (may take longer on first run while tools install)
```

```bash
# Try the tool
./vscan --help

# ‚úÖ Expected: Help message displays with available commands
```

**Total setup time:** 10-15 minutes

---

## üîß Troubleshooting Setup

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### ‚ùå `pip install -e .[dev,test]` fails with "invalid syntax"

**Solution:** Upgrade pip first
```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

#### ‚ùå Pre-commit hooks fail on first run

**This is expected!** Pre-commit downloads tools on the first run.

**Solution:** Just run it again
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### ‚ùå `./vscan` command not found or "Permission denied"

**Solution:** Make the script executable
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root directory
cd vsc-extension-scanner
chmod +x vscan
./vscan --help
```

#### ‚ùå Tests fail with "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'vscode_scanner'"

**Solution:** Reinstall in editable mode
```bash
pip install -e .
```

#### ‚ùå `git push` fails with authentication error

**Solution:** Set up GitHub authentication
- Option 1: [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- Option 2: [SSH Keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

#### ‚ùå Pre-commit hooks are too slow

**Solution:** Run on staged files only (default behavior)
```bash
git add changed_file.py
git commit  # Only checks staged files
```

**Still stuck?**

Open an [issue](https://github.com/jvlivonius/vsc-extension-scanner/issues/new) with:
- Your OS and Python version (`python3 --version`)
- Complete error message (paste full output)
- What you were trying to do
- What you expected to happen

We're happy to help! üôÇ

## Git Workflow

This project uses **Simplified GitHub Flow**. Full details in [GIT_WORKFLOW.md](docs/contributing/GIT_WORKFLOW.md).

### Quick Guide

```bash
# 1. Always start from updated main
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# 2. Create feature branch (use descriptive name!)
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Make changes, commit frequently with clear messages
git add .
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"

# 4. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Create pull request on GitHub
gh pr create --title "feat: your feature" --body "Description"
# Or use GitHub web interface
```

### Branch Naming Conventions

Use the format: `<type>/<short-descriptive-name>`

- `feature/*` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-csv-export`)
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/cache-corruption`)
- `hotfix/*` - Critical security/data fixes (e.g., `hotfix/path-traversal`)
- `docs/*` - Documentation changes (e.g., `docs/improve-testing-guide`)
- `test/*` - Test improvements (e.g., `test/add-integration-tests`)

### Commit Message Format

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `hotfix` - Critical security/data fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `test` - Testing updates
- `refactor` - Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, build, etc.)
- `perf` - Performance improvements

**Examples:**
```
feat(scanner): add parallel processing support
fix(cache): prevent corruption with HMAC validation
docs(security): update vulnerability reporting process
test(cli): add integration tests for --output flag
refactor(display): simplify progress bar logic
chore(deps): update typer to 0.9.0
```

---

## Making Changes

### Before You Start

1. **‚úÖ Check scope:** Is your change aligned with project goals? Review [PRD.md](docs/project/PRD.md)
2. **‚úÖ Search existing issues/PRs:** Avoid duplicate work
3. **‚úÖ Create an issue first:** For significant changes (new features, major refactors), create an issue to discuss approach before implementing

### Development Guidelines

#### Security Requirements (üî¥ CRITICAL)

**All file paths MUST use `validate_path()`:**

```python
from vscode_scanner.utils import validate_path

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always validate user-provided paths
validated_path = validate_path(user_input)
with open(validated_path, 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()

# ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS - Path traversal vulnerability!
with open(user_input, 'r') as f:  # Security vulnerability!
    data = f.read()
```

**All user-facing strings MUST use `sanitize_string()`:**

```python
from vscode_scanner.utils import sanitize_string

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Prevent injection attacks
print(sanitize_string(extension_name, context='output'))
console.print(sanitize_string(error_msg, context='error'))

# ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS - Potential injection vulnerability!
print(f"Extension: {extension_name}")  # Unsanitized!
console.print(f"Error: {error_msg}")   # Unsanitized!
```

**Why this matters:**
- `validate_path()` prevents directory traversal attacks (e.g., `../../etc/passwd`)
- `sanitize_string()` prevents terminal injection and control character exploits
- Security tests MUST pass with 0 vulnerabilities before any commit

See [SECURITY.md](docs/guides/SECURITY.md) for complete security requirements.

#### Architecture Principles

1. **3-Layer Architecture:** Presentation ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Infrastructure (one-way dependencies only)
2. **No layer violations:** Infrastructure layer must NEVER import from Presentation layer
3. **KISS Principle:** Simple solutions over clever ones
4. **Fail Fast:** Invalid input should raise errors immediately, don't continue processing

**Example of correct layering:**
```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Presentation can import from Application
# In cli.py (Presentation):
from vscode_scanner.scanner import scan_extensions  # OK

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Application can import from Infrastructure
# In scanner.py (Application):
from vscode_scanner.cache_manager import get_cached_result  # OK

# ‚ùå WRONG - Infrastructure importing from Presentation
# In cache_manager.py (Infrastructure):
from vscode_scanner.display import format_output  # VIOLATION!
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete architectural rules and anti-patterns.

#### Testing Requirements

- **All new features:** Must have tests demonstrating they work
- **Bug fixes:** Must have regression tests preventing the bug from returning
- **Security changes:** Must pass ALL security tests with 0 vulnerabilities
- **Coverage targets:**
  - Security modules (`utils.py`): ‚â•95% coverage
  - Core logic (`scanner.py`, `cache_manager.py`): ‚â•85% coverage
  - Presentation layer (`cli.py`, `display.py`): ‚â•70% coverage
  - Overall project: ‚â•70% coverage (target: 85%)

**Why different targets?** Security-critical code needs near-perfect coverage to prevent vulnerabilities. Presentation layer can have lower coverage as it's mostly formatting.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from common pitfalls! Here's what to watch out for:

### ‚ùå Security: Not using validation functions

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Security vulnerability!
def read_extension_file(path):
    with open(path, 'r') as f:  # No validation!
        return f.read()

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always validate paths
from vscode_scanner.utils import validate_path

def read_extension_file(path):
    validated_path = validate_path(path)
    with open(validated_path, 'r') as f:
        return f.read()
```

### ‚ùå Git: Working directly on main branch

```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG - Changes on main can't be easily managed in PRs
git checkout main
# make changes directly on main...
git commit -m "changes"

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always use feature branches
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b feature/my-improvement
# make changes on feature branch...
git commit -m "feat: my improvement"
```

### ‚ùå Testing: Skipping or commenting out tests to make build pass

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Hiding test failures
# def test_security_validation():
#     assert validate_path("../../etc/passwd")  # Commented out!

# ‚ùå WRONG - Skipping tests
@pytest.mark.skip("TODO: fix this later")
def test_security_validation():
    assert validate_path("../../etc/passwd")

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Fix the code, don't hide the test failure
def test_security_validation():
    with pytest.raises(SecurityError):  # Fixed test
        validate_path("../../etc/passwd")
```

### ‚ùå Architecture: Layer violations

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Infrastructure importing from Presentation
# In cache_manager.py (Infrastructure layer):
from vscode_scanner.display import format_output  # Violation!

def get_cached_result(key):
    result = cache.get(key)
    return format_output(result)  # Presentation logic in Infrastructure!

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Keep layers separate
# In cache_manager.py (Infrastructure layer):
def get_cached_result(key):
    return cache.get(key)  # Just return data

# In cli.py (Presentation layer):
from vscode_scanner.cache_manager import get_cached_result
from vscode_scanner.display import format_output

result = get_cached_result(key)
formatted = format_output(result)  # Presentation handles formatting
```

### ‚ùå Code Style: Inconsistent formatting

```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - Mixed styles, no consistency
def myFunction( x,y ):
    if x>0:
        return x+y
    else: return x-y

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Consistent style (Black formatter enforces this)
def my_function(x, y):
    """Add or subtract y from x based on x's sign."""
    if x > 0:
        return x + y
    else:
        return x - y
```

**Pro tip:** Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing to catch these issues automatically!

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [SECURITY.md](docs/guides/SECURITY.md) for more details.

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (recommended before committing)
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
python3 tests/test_security.py

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=vscode_scanner --cov-report=html
# Open htmlcov/index.html to see detailed coverage

# Run only tests matching a pattern
pytest tests/ -k "security"
```

### Required Security Tests (MUST pass before ANY commit)

```bash
# Run security vulnerability tests
python3 tests/test_security.py

# Run comprehensive security regression suite
python3 tests/test_security_regression.py

# Run path validation tests
python3 tests/test_path_validation.py

# Run string sanitization tests
python3 tests/test_string_sanitization.py

# ‚úÖ All must show: 0 vulnerabilities, all tests passed
```

### Additional Quality Tests

```bash
# Run architecture compliance tests (must show 0 layer violations)
python3 tests/test_architecture.py

# Run integration tests
python3 tests/test_integration.py

# Run performance benchmarks
python3 tests/test_performance.py
```

### Coverage Expectations by Module

| Module | Current | Target | Priority | Why? |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|------|
| `utils.py` | 95% | 95% | üî¥ Critical | Security functions - path validation, sanitization |
| `scanner.py` | 85% | 85% | üü° High | Core scanning logic - reliability essential |
| `cache_manager.py` | 85% | 85% | üü° High | HMAC integrity - prevents tampering |
| `cli.py` | 70% | 70% | üü¢ Standard | CLI interface - focus on critical paths |
| `display.py` | 60% | 70% | üü¢ Standard | Formatting - less critical than logic |
| **Overall** | **72%** | **85%** | üü° High | Project-wide quality target |

**Why different targets?**
- **95% for security modules:** Near-perfect coverage prevents vulnerabilities
- **85% for core logic:** High coverage ensures reliability
- **70% for presentation:** Focus on critical paths, formatting less critical

### Test Organization

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_security.py              # Security vulnerability tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_security_regression.py   # Comprehensive security suite (95%+ coverage)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_path_validation.py       # Path validation coverage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_string_sanitization.py   # String sanitization coverage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_cache_integrity.py       # HMAC integrity tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_sqlite_security.py       # SQLite security audit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_architecture.py          # Layer compliance verification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_scanner.py               # Scanner module tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_cli.py                   # CLI module tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_display.py               # Display module tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_integration.py           # End-to-end workflow tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_performance.py           # Performance benchmarks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_property_based.py        # Hypothesis property tests (1,250+ scenarios)
```

### Writing New Tests - Template

Use the **AAA (Arrange-Act-Assert)** pattern for all tests:

```python
def test_feature_name():
    """Test that feature_name handles expected_scenario correctly.

    This test verifies that [specific behavior] works as expected
    when [specific conditions].
    """
    # Arrange: Set up test data and conditions
    input_data = "test_value"
    expected_result = "expected_output"

    # Act: Execute the feature under test
    actual_result = feature_function(input_data)

    # Assert: Verify the expected outcome
    assert actual_result == expected_result
    assert isinstance(actual_result, str)  # Additional assertions as needed
```

**Example - Testing path validation:**

```python
def test_validate_path_blocks_directory_traversal():
    """Test that validate_path blocks directory traversal attempts.

    This test verifies that path validation raises SecurityError
    when user input contains directory traversal patterns.
    """
    # Arrange: Create malicious path input
    malicious_path = "../../etc/passwd"

    # Act & Assert: Should raise SecurityError
    with pytest.raises(SecurityError):
        validate_path(malicious_path)
```

See [TESTING.md](docs/guides/TESTING.md) for comprehensive testing guide and specialized testing documentation in [docs/guides/testing/](docs/guides/testing/).

- **Linter:** [Pylint](https://pylint.org/) (enforced by pre-commit hooks)
- **Security:** [Bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) (AST-based security analysis)
- **Import sorting:** [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) (groups: stdlib, third-party, local)
- **Type hints:** Encouraged for public APIs, required for security-critical functions
- **Docstrings:** [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) for all public functions and classes

**All style checks run automatically via pre-commit hooks!**

### Docstring Example

```python
def scan_extension(extension_path: str, cache: bool = True) -> ScanResult:
    """Scan a VS Code extension for security vulnerabilities.

    Args:
        extension_path: Absolute path to extension directory
        cache: Whether to use cached results if available

    Returns:
        ScanResult object containing vulnerability information

    Raises:
        SecurityError: If path validation fails
        APIError: If vscan.dev API is unreachable

    Example:
        >>> result = scan_extension("/path/to/extension")
        >>> print(result.risk_level)
        'high'
    """
```

### Code Comments - Best Practices

```python
# ‚ùå BAD - Explaining what (obvious from code)
x = x + 1  # Increment x

# ‚úÖ GOOD - Explaining why (non-obvious reasoning)
# Use exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming API during rate limit recovery
time.sleep(2 ** retry_count)

# ‚úÖ GOOD - Warning about subtle issues
# Note: SQLite connections are not thread-safe, use separate connection per thread
connection = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
```

### Documentation Guidelines

- **Markdown formatting:** Follow project conventions (see [DOCUMENTATION_CONVENTIONS.md](docs/contributing/DOCUMENTATION_CONVENTIONS.md))
- **Line length:** Wrap at 100-120 characters for readability
- **Code blocks:** Always specify language for syntax highlighting
- **Links:** Use relative paths for internal docs, absolute for external
- **Examples:** Provide before/after or good/bad examples where helpful

### Layer Architecture (CRITICAL - Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md))

**3-Layer Architecture with one-way dependencies:**

```
Presentation Layer (CLI, Display, HTML Reports)
    ‚Üì can import from
Application Layer (Scanner, Types)
    ‚Üì can import from
Infrastructure Layer (API, Cache, Utils, Config)
```

**Key rules:**
- ‚úÖ Presentation can import from Application and Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Application can import from Infrastructure
- ‚ùå Infrastructure MUST NEVER import from Presentation or Application
- ‚ùå No circular dependencies between modules

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/guides/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architectural guidelines and anti-patterns.

## üìö Glossary

Understanding technical terms used in this project:

**AAA Pattern**
: Arrange-Act-Assert testing pattern (setup ‚Üí execute ‚Üí verify). Standard test structure used throughout the codebase.

**Architecture Layer**
: One of three layers (Presentation, Application, Infrastructure) defining module responsibilities and dependencies.

**Bandit**
: AST-based security analyzer for Python that detects common security issues.

**Black**
: Opinionated Python code formatter that enforces consistent style automatically.

**HMAC**
: Hash-based Message Authentication Code - ensures cache integrity and prevents tampering with security scores.

**Layer Violation**
: When code imports from a layer it shouldn't depend on (e.g., Infrastructure importing from Presentation).

**LSP (Language Server Protocol)**
: Protocol providing IDE features like go-to-definition, autocomplete, etc.

**Pre-commit Hook**
: Git hook that runs automated checks (linting, security, formatting) before allowing commits.

**Property-Based Testing**
: Testing approach using automatically generated inputs to test properties/invariants (we use Hypothesis library).

**Pytest**
: Python testing framework used for all tests in this project.

**Sanitization**
: Process of removing dangerous characters from user input to prevent injection attacks.

**Security Context**
: The intended use of a string (output, log, error) determining which characters to sanitize.

**Squash Merge**
: Git merge strategy that combines all PR commits into a single commit on main branch.

**Validation**
: Checking that input meets security and format requirements before processing.

**vscan.dev**
: Third-party security analysis service that powers the extension scanning functionality.
