## Phase 2 Tools Implementation

### Tool 1: Dependabot (30 minutes) ✅

**Goal:** Automated weekly dependency updates with GitHub Security integration

**Implementation:**
- **File Created:** `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **Schedule:** Weekly updates every Monday at 09:00 UTC
- **Grouping Strategy:**
  - Dev dependencies grouped: pytest, black, pylint, bandit, safety, pip-audit, pre-commit, hypothesis, coverage
  - Production dependencies grouped: rich, typer
  - Reduces PR noise from 10+ individual PRs to 2 grouped PRs
- **Security Integration:** GitHub Security Advisories automatically trigger dependency updates
- **PR Limits:** Maximum 5 open PRs to prevent overwhelming maintainers

**Configuration:**
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "pip"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
      day: "monday"
      time: "09:00"
    groups:
      dev-dependencies:
        patterns: ["pytest*", "black*", "pylint*", ...]
      production-dependencies:
        patterns: ["rich*", "typer*"]
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5
```

**Benefits:**
- Zero manual effort for routine dependency updates
- Automatic security patch notifications
- Grouped PRs reduce review burden
- GitHub Security tab integration

---

### Tool 2: Coverage.py Enhancement (1 hour) ✅

**Goal:** Branch coverage tracking with 85% CI enforcement

**Implementation:**
- **File Created:** `.coveragerc` (configuration)
- **File Updated:** `.github/workflows/security.yml` (added coverage job)
- **File Updated:** `pyproject.toml` (added coverage dependency)
- **Coverage Type:** Branch coverage (more comprehensive than line coverage)
- **Threshold:** 85% minimum (enforced in CI/CD)
- **Reports:** HTML, XML, JSON formats generated
- **CI Integration:** New "Coverage Analysis" job in security workflow

**Configuration (.coveragerc):**
```ini
[run]
branch = True  # Enable branch coverage
source = vscode_scanner
omit = */tests/*, */__init__.py

[report]
precision = 2
show_missing = True
fail_under = 85.0  # Fail CI if below 85%

[html]
directory = htmlcov
```

**GitHub Actions Integration:**
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    coverage run -m pytest tests/ -v
    coverage report --fail-under=85
    coverage html

- name: Upload coverage report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: coverage-report
    path: htmlcov/
```

**Benefits:**
- Branch coverage tests error paths (if/else branches)
- 85% threshold ensures comprehensive testing
- HTML reports for visual analysis
- CI enforcement prevents coverage regressions
- Artifacts uploaded for review

---

### Tool 3: Semgrep OSS (3 hours) ✅

**Goal:** Custom security rules for project-specific patterns

**Rationale:** Replaces CodeQL for private repositories (CodeQL requires GitHub Enterprise at $49/user/month = $588/year)

**Implementation:**
- **File Created:** `.github/workflows/semgrep.yml` (workflow)
- **File Created:** `.semgrep.yml` (6 custom security rules)
- **Schedule:** Weekly scans every Sunday at 00:00 UTC
- **Trigger:** On push/PR to main/master/develop/claude/** branches

**Custom Security Rules (6 total):**

1. **missing-path-validation-open** (ERROR)
   - Enforces `validate_path()` usage before file operations
   - Prevents path traversal attacks (CWE-22)
   - Pattern: `open($PATH, ...)` without prior `validate_path()` call

2. **missing-string-sanitization-print** (WARNING)
   - Enforces `sanitize_string()` for terminal output
   - Prevents injection attacks (CWE-74)
   - Pattern: `print($USER_INPUT)` without prior `sanitize_string()` call

3. **missing-string-sanitization-logging** (WARNING)
   - Enforces `sanitize_string()` for log messages
   - Prevents log injection (CWE-117)
   - Pattern: `logging.$LEVEL($MSG)` without sanitization

4. **sql-injection-risk-execute** (ERROR)
   - Enforces parameterized queries
   - Prevents SQL injection (CWE-89)
   - Pattern: `cursor.execute($QUERY)` without parameterization

5. **dangerous-file-operations** (ERROR)
   - Detects dangerous operations: `eval()`, `exec()`, `shell=True`
   - Prevents code injection (CWE-95, CWE-78)
   - Pattern: `os.system()`, `subprocess.call(..., shell=True)`

6. **weak-cryptography** (WARNING)
   - Detects MD5/SHA1 usage
   - Recommends SHA256+ for security (CWE-327)
   - Pattern: `hashlib.md5()`, `hashlib.sha1()`

**Workflow Configuration:**
```yaml
name: Semgrep Security Scan
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master, develop, 'claude/**']
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly Sunday

jobs:
  semgrep:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: returntocorp/semgrep
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: semgrep scan --config=.semgrep.yml vscode_scanner/
```

**Benefits:**
- Custom rules enforce project-specific security patterns
- Free for private repositories (vs $588/year for CodeQL)
- Low false positive rate
- Pattern-based detection (faster than semantic analysis)
- Weekly automated scans

3. **test_idempotent_sanitization** (500 examples)
   - Property: `sanitize(sanitize(x)) == sanitize(x)`
   - Tests mathematical property of idempotency
   - Ensures consistency

**Property Tests - Cache Integrity:**

1. **test_cache_roundtrip_preserves_data** (500 examples)
   - Property: Store → Retrieve should match
   - Tests HMAC doesn't corrupt data
   - Data integrity validation

2. **test_tampering_always_detected** (300 examples)

   - Zero false negatives required

**Example Test Code:**
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st, settings

@given(st.text())
@settings(max_examples=1000, deadline=None)
def test_validate_path_never_crashes(self, path_input):
    """validate_path should handle any string without crashing."""
    try:
        result = validate_path(path_input)
        self.assertIsInstance(result, str)
    except (SecurityError, ValueError, OSError):
        pass  # Expected for invalid paths
    except Exception as e:
        self.fail(f"Unexpected crash: {e}")
```

**Benefits:**
- Automated edge case discovery (finds bugs developers miss)
- 4,000+ test cases per run (exponentially more than manual tests)
- Property-based > example-based (tests invariants, not just examples)
- Complements existing example-based test suite
- High-confidence security validation

## Future Enhancements (Phase 3 - Deferred)

**12 tools deferred to v3.6+ based on ROI analysis:**

1. **CodeQL** - Requires GitHub Enterprise ($588/year); Semgrep OSS sufficient
2. **Mypy** - Type checking adds maintenance burden; limited security benefit
3. **OWASP ZAP** - API security testing; CLI tool has no external API
4. **Radon** - Complexity metrics; codebase already simple (<1500 LOC)
5. **Vulture** - Dead code detection; lean codebase with high test coverage
6. **pytest-xdist** - Parallel testing; test suite already fast (<10s)
7. **Locust** - Load testing; no performance bottleneck
8. **mitmproxy** - HTTP debugging; no external HTTP calls
9. **sqlitebiter** - Database import/export; unnecessary for single-purpose cache
10. **pytest-timeout** - Test timeout protection; no long-running tests
11. **pytest-mock** - Mocking library; unittest.mock sufficient
12. **pytest-benchmark** - Performance benchmarking; no performance-critical paths

**Re-evaluation Triggers:**
- Repository becomes public → Enable CodeQL
- Codebase grows >5000 LOC → Consider Radon, Vulture
- REST API added → Consider OWASP ZAP, Locust
- Team grows >5 developers → Consider Mypy
- Performance issues emerge → Consider pytest-benchmark
