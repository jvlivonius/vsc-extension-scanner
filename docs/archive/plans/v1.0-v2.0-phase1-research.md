# Phase 1: Research & Discovery

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Duration:** Week 1
**Completion Date:** 2025-10-22

---

## Overview

Phase 1 focuses on reverse-engineering the vscan.dev API to understand how to programmatically query extension security data. This is a critical foundation phase since vscan.dev does not provide documented public API endpoints.

---

## Objectives

1. **Reverse-engineer vscan.dev API endpoints** used by the web interface
2. **Document request/response formats** for all discovered endpoints
3. **Validate endpoint behavior** with real VS Code extensions
4. **Understand rate limiting** and authentication requirements
5. **Create proof-of-concept** API client script

---

## Requirements

### R1.1: API Endpoint Discovery
- **MUST** identify the complete API workflow for extension analysis
- **MUST** document HTTP methods, headers, and parameters for each endpoint
- **MUST** capture example requests and responses
- **SHOULD** use browser developer tools to monitor network traffic

### R1.2: Request/Response Documentation
- **MUST** document the structure of API requests (JSON schemas, query parameters)
- **MUST** document the structure of API responses with all available fields
- **MUST** identify required vs. optional fields
- **MUST** document error response formats

### R1.3: Validation Testing
- **MUST** test API with at least 3 different extensions
- **MUST** test with both popular and obscure extensions
- **MUST** test with invalid extension IDs to understand error handling
- **MUST** validate response consistency across multiple requests

### R1.4: Rate Limiting Analysis
- **MUST** identify if rate limiting exists
- **MUST** document rate limit thresholds if applicable
- **MUST** identify HTTP status codes and headers related to rate limiting
- **SHOULD** determine appropriate request delay to avoid throttling

### R1.5: Proof of Concept
- **MUST** create a working Python script (`test_api.py`) that:
  - Submits an extension for analysis
  - Polls for analysis completion
  - Retrieves and displays results
- **MUST** demonstrate successful API interaction with real data
- **SHOULD** include error handling for common failure scenarios

**File:** `test_api.py`

**Features:**
- Extension submission to vscan.dev
- Status polling mechanism
- Result retrieval and parsing
- Basic error handling
- Pretty-printed JSON output
- Test with 3+ sample extensions

### D1.3: Test Results
**File:** [docs/results/PHASE1_TEST_RESULTS.md](../results/PHASE1_TEST_RESULTS.md)

**Contents:**
- Test execution results for sample extensions
- API response samples
- Identified issues or limitations
- Recommendations for Phase 2

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All API endpoints documented with examples
- [ ] `test_api.py` successfully queries vscan.dev for extensions
- [ ] Response data structure fully understood and documented
- [ ] Rate limiting behavior identified and documented
- [ ] Proof of concept validates API workflow end-to-end
- [ ] Documentation sufficient for Phase 2 implementation

## Technical Approach

### Step 1: Network Traffic Analysis
1. Open vscan.dev in Chrome/Firefox with Developer Tools
2. Navigate to Network tab
3. Submit extension for analysis (e.g., "ms-python.python")
4. Capture all HTTP requests and responses
5. Document endpoints, methods, headers, payloads

### Step 2: API Workflow Identification
1. Identify initial submission endpoint
2. Identify status checking endpoint (polling)
3. Identify results retrieval endpoint
4. Document the complete workflow sequence
5. Test if results are cached for popular extensions

### Step 3: Response Analysis
1. Parse JSON responses from each endpoint
2. Document all available fields
3. Identify which fields are essential for the tool
4. Map vscan.dev data to desired output schema

### Step 4: Proof of Concept Development
1. Create `test_api.py` using Python `urllib` (no external dependencies)
2. Implement the discovered API workflow
3. Test with multiple extensions
4. Add basic error handling
5. Validate response parsing

### Step 5: Documentation
1. Write comprehensive API_RESEARCH.md
2. Include curl examples for all endpoints
3. Document findings and recommendations
4. Identify any risks or limitations

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API is undocumented and may change | High | Document current behavior thoroughly; implement version checking in Phase 2 |
| Rate limiting may block testing | Medium | Use appropriate delays; test with small sample set |
| API may require authentication | High | Investigate auth mechanisms; document workarounds if possible |
| Responses may vary by extension type | Medium | Test with diverse extension set; document edge cases |
| API may not be publicly accessible | Critical | Contact vscan.dev team if necessary; consider alternative approaches |

---

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Browser with Developer Tools (Chrome/Firefox)
- Internet connectivity
- Access to vscan.dev

---

## Timeline

| Task | Duration | Dependencies |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Network traffic analysis | 1 day | None |
| API workflow documentation | 1 day | Traffic analysis complete |
| Proof of concept development | 2 days | API workflow documented |
| Testing and validation | 1 day | PoC complete |
| Documentation | 1 day | Testing complete |

**Total Duration:** 1 week
