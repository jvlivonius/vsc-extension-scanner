## Key Features

### Module-by-Module Risk Display

The centerpiece of v5.0.3 is the new `--detailed` flag that reveals the complete security analysis breakdown for any extension.

**What's included:**
- Individual risk assessments for all 11 security modules
- Score contributions showing how each module affects the final security score
- Color-coded risk levels (red for high, yellow for medium, green for low)
- Visual indicators: ⚠️ (high risk), ⚡ (medium risk), ✓ (low risk)

**11 Security Modules Displayed:**
1. **Metadata** - Extension metadata analysis
2. **Dependencies** - Dependency vulnerability checking
3. **Socket (Supply Chain)** - Socket.dev supply chain analysis
4. **VirusTotal** - Malware scanning results
5. **Permissions** - VS Code permission analysis
6. **OSSF Scorecard** - OpenSSF security metrics
7. **Network Endpoints** - Network call detection
8. **Sensitive Info** - Credential/secret scanning
9. **Obfuscation** - Code obfuscation detection
10. **AST Analysis** - AST-based code analysis
11. **Pattern Scanning** - Pattern-based security checks

**Usage:**
```bash
# Show detailed module breakdown in terminal
vscan scan ms-python.python --detailed

# Generate HTML report with module breakdown
vscan scan ms-python.python --detailed --output report.html
```

### Enhanced HTML Reports

HTML reports now include a professional "Security Analysis Breakdown" section:
- Responsive table layout with color-coded risk levels
- Self-contained CSS styling (no external dependencies)
- Clear presentation of module impacts on security scores
- Mobile and desktop friendly design
