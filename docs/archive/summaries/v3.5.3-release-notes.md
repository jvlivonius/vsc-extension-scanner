---

## What's New

v3.5.3 delivers Testing Excellence with dramatic improvements in test coverage, achieving **72.60% overall coverage** (exceeding the 70% target by 3.7%) and comprehensive documentation restructuring. This release adds **94 new tests**, bringing the total to **628 tests** with a **100% pass rate**.

### ðŸ“Š Massive Coverage Improvement

**Test Coverage Achievement** exceeds expectations:
- Overall coverage: 52.07% â†’ **72.60%** (+20.53 percentage points)
- Total tests: 534 â†’ **628 tests** (+94 tests, +17.6% increase)
- Test pass rate: **100%** (628 passed, 1 skipped)
- Security coverage: **95%+** maintained
- Property-based tests: **20 tests generating 1,250+ scenarios**

**Impact:** Exceeded 70% coverage target by 3.7%, achieving 103.7% of goal

### ðŸ§ª Phase 4.1: Utility Function Testing

**New test file: `tests/test_utils.py`** with 40 comprehensive tests:
- Tests for `format_duration()` - Human-readable time formatting
- Tests for `truncate_text()` - Text length limiting with ellipsis
- Tests for `safe_mkdir()` - Directory creation with Unix permission handling
- Tests for `get_error_type()` - Error classification logic
- Platform-aware testing for Unix-specific features
- Coverage improvement: `utils.py` from ~50% â†’ **64.50%**

**Impact:** Critical utility functions now thoroughly validated

### ðŸŽ¨ Phase 4.2: Display Module Testing

**Enhanced `tests/test_display.py`** from 23 â†’ 53 tests (+130% increase):
- New edge case tests for retry statistics display
- New tests for failed extensions reporting
- Table generation tests with complex data structures
- Enhanced summary panel validation
- Coverage improvement: `display.py` from ~60% â†’ **80.58%**

**Impact:** User-facing display logic now highly reliable

### ðŸ”— Phase 4.3: Integration Test Analysis

**Comprehensive integration validation**:
- Analyzed `tests/test_integration.py` (7 existing tests)
- Validated end-to-end workflow coverage (discovery â†’ scanning â†’ caching â†’ output)
- Architectural decision: CLI integration tests deferred due to complexity
- Existing `test_cli.py` deemed adequate for current needs

**Impact:** Integration test strategy refined and validated

### âœ… Phase 4.4: Coverage Validation

**HTML coverage report and gap analysis**:
- Generated comprehensive HTML coverage report: `htmlcov/index.html`
- Module-by-module gap analysis completed
- Created Phase 4 summary document (400+ lines)
- Identified priority modules for future improvements

**Impact:** Clear visibility into coverage metrics and improvement opportunities

### ðŸ“š Phase 4.5: Documentation Restructuring

**TESTING.md**: Transformed from 2,800 â†’ **486 lines** (83% reduction):
- Compact main overview with clear structure
- Cross-references to specialized guides

**Created `docs/guides/testing/` with 11 focused guides:**
1. `testing/README.md` - Navigation index
2. `testing/TESTING_SECURITY.md` (21K) - Comprehensive security testing (102 tests, 95%+ coverage)
3. `testing/TESTING_COVERAGE.md` (7.5K) - Coverage strategy and goals
4. `testing/TESTING_INTEGRATION.md` (8.8K) - Integration patterns
5. `testing/TESTING_MOCKING.md` (10K) - Mocking guidelines with canonical mocks
6. `testing/TESTING_PROPERTY_BASED.md` (4.5K) - Hypothesis testing (1,250+ scenarios)
7. `testing/TESTING_CLI.md` (2K) - CLI testing guide
8. `testing/TESTING_PERFORMANCE.md` (2K) - Performance benchmarks
9. `testing/TESTING_PARALLEL.md` (1.3K) - Parallel scanning tests
10. `testing/TESTING_RETRY.md` (1.8K) - Retry mechanism testing
11. `testing/TESTING_HTML_REPORTS.md` (1.1K) - HTML report validation

**Impact:** Easier navigation, reduced maintenance burden, clearer testing guidelines

### ðŸ”§ Phase 4.6: Test Infrastructure Fix

**Resolved test failures** achieving 100% pass rate:
- Fixed CliRunner stderr capture issues (7 tests affected)
- Resolved 4 failures in `tests/test_cache_commands.py`
- Resolved 3 failures in `tests/test_error_handling.py`
- Root cause: CliRunner stderr access incompatibility
- Solution: Changed from `result.stdout + result.stderr` to `result.output`

**Impact:** 100% test pass rate achieved (628 passed, 1 skipped)
