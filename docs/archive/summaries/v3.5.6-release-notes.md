**Release Date:** November 1, 2025
**Type:** Patch Release (CI/CD Automation + Post-Refactoring Fixes)
**Status:** Production Ready

---

## Overview

Version 3.5.6 is a patch release that adds automated GitHub Actions release workflow and addresses critical security and distribution issues discovered after the v3.5.4 HTML Report Generator refactoring, along with important documentation improvements for Git workflow standardization.

**Key Updates:**
- 🛡️ **Security Fix**: Case-insensitive filesystem bypass prevention
- 📦 **Distribution Fix**: HTML report assets properly included in package
- 📚 **Documentation**: Comprehensive Git workflow integration
- ✅ **Testing**: Property test improvements for path validation

---

## What's Fixed

### 🛡️ Security Fixes

**Case-Insensitive Filesystem Bypass Prevention**

Fixed a security vulnerability where path validation could be bypassed on case-insensitive filesystems (macOS, Windows) by using alternative case for system paths.

**Impact:** Medium
- **Vulnerability**: System paths could bypass validation on case-insensitive filesystems
- **Example**: `/Users` could be accessed as `/users` or `/USERS` on macOS
- **Fix**: Path prefix comparison now uses case-insensitive matching on case-insensitive filesystems
- **Commit**: 09c1836

**Affected Platforms:**
- macOS (case-insensitive APFS by default)
- Windows (NTFS case-insensitive)
- Linux with case-insensitive filesystems

### 📦 Distribution Fixes

**HTML Report Assets Inclusion**

Fixed critical distribution issue where HTML report CSS and JavaScript assets were not included in the PyPI package, causing HTML report generation to fail for users installing from PyPI.

**Impact:** High (for HTML report users)
- **Issue**: Missing `report_styles.css` and `report_scripts.js` in distributed package
- **Symptom**: HTML reports would fail to generate with file not found errors
- **Fix**: Updated `MANIFEST.in` to include `html_report/assets/*` files
- **Commit**: b85d589

**Verification:**
```bash
# Assets now properly included in wheel
python3 -m zipfile -l dist/vscode_extension_scanner-3.5.6-py3-none-any.whl | grep assets
```

### ✅ Testing Improvements

**Property Test Path Validation Fix**

Corrected property-based test to use proper path prefix matching instead of substring matching, improving test accuracy and preventing false positives.

**Changes:**
- **Before**: Used substring matching which could match unintended paths
- **After**: Uses explicit path prefix matching with proper path separators
- **Benefit**: More accurate testing of path validation logic
- **Commit**: 08a7e40
