**Release Date:** 2025-10-26
**Release Type:** Major (Breaking Changes)
**Status:** Production Ready âœ…

---

## ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES

This is a **major release** with breaking changes that simplify the API and improve performance by default.

### What Changed

1. **Parallel processing is now the default**
   - No flags needed for 4.88x speedup (3 workers automatically)
   - Real-world impact: 66 extensions from 6 minutes â†’ 1.2 minutes (by default!)

2. **Removed `--parallel` flag**
   - No longer needed (parallel is always on)
   - Breaking change for scripts using `--parallel`

3. **Workers range: 2-5 â†’ 1-5**
   - Use `--workers 1` for sequential behavior
   - Breaking change for users needing sequential mode

4. **Removed `parallel` config setting**
   - Remove `parallel = true/false` from `~/.vscanrc`
   - Only `workers` setting remains (range: 1-5)

---

## Migration Guide

### Command Line

**Old Commands (v3.4.0):**
```bash
vscan scan                  # Sequential (slow)
vscan scan --parallel       # 3 workers (fast)
vscan scan --parallel --workers 5  # 5 workers
```

**New Commands (v3.5.0):**
```bash
vscan scan                  # 3 workers (fast) - NEW DEFAULT!
vscan scan --workers 1      # Sequential (if needed)
vscan scan --workers 5      # 5 workers
```

### Configuration File (~/.vscanrc)

**Old Configuration (v3.4.0):**
```ini
[scan]
parallel = true             # REMOVE THIS LINE
workers = 3                 # Keep this
```

**New Configuration (v3.5.0):**
```ini
[scan]
workers = 3                 # Range: 1-5, default: 3
```

### Action Required

1. **Remove `--parallel` flag from all scripts**
   - Scripts using `vscan scan --parallel` should change to `vscan scan`

2. **Remove `parallel` setting from `~/.vscanrc`**
   - Edit `~/.vscanrc` and delete the `parallel = true/false` line

3. **For sequential behavior: use `--workers 1`**
   - If you need sequential mode, add `--workers 1` flag

## Key Features

### Performance by Default
- **4.88x speedup automatically** (no flags needed!)
- **3 workers by default** (configurable 1-5)
- **Real-world impact:** 66 extensions from 6 minutes â†’ 1.2 minutes

### Code Simplification
- **~100 lines eliminated** (single unified code path)
- **Removed duplicate implementations** (sequential vs parallel)
- **Simpler API:** One concept (workers), not two (parallel + workers)

### Architecture Improvements
- **Solves v3.4.1 Tasks 1 & 6 automatically**
  - Task 1: Code duplication (~300 lines duplicated) âœ… SOLVED
  - Task 6: Progress display duplication (~100 lines) âœ… SOLVED
- **Reduced roadmap:** 8 days â†’ 3.25 days (59% reduction)
- **Architectural score:** 85/100 â†’ 90/100

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

**Phase 1-2: Core Implementation**
- `scanner.py`: Removed `_scan_extensions()` function, renamed `_scan_extensions_parallel()` â†’ `_scan_extensions()`
- `cli.py`: Removed `--parallel` parameter, updated `--workers` min from 2 to 1
- `config_manager.py`: Removed `parallel` setting, updated workers range to 1-5
- `_version.py`: Bumped to 3.5.0
- `tests/test_parallel_scanning.py`: Updated function imports

**Phase 3: Documentation**
- Updated 8 documentation files (CHANGELOG, README, CLAUDE, STATUS, PRD, roadmap)
- Added comprehensive migration guide to CHANGELOG.md
- Updated all examples and command references

**Phase 4: Testing**
- Fixed remaining `parallel` parameter reference bug
- Smoke test passed: 66 extensions scanned successfully
- Build verified: wheel and tar.gz generated

### Implementation Details

**ThreadPoolExecutor with max_workers=1:**
- Provides sequential behavior when needed
- No need for separate sequential code path
- Single unified implementation

**Breaking Change Rationale:**
- Performance by default benefits all users
- Simpler API reduces confusion
- Eliminates maintenance burden of dual code paths
- ThreadPoolExecutor handles both modes efficiently

## What's Next

### v3.5.1 Roadmap (Reduced Scope)

The v3.5.0 release eliminated 2 of 6 planned tasks from the original v3.4.1 roadmap:

**Completed in v3.5.0:**
- ~~Task 1: Code duplication~~ âœ… SOLVED
- ~~Task 6: Progress display duplication~~ âœ… SOLVED

**Remaining Tasks (3.25 days):**
- Task 2: Thread-safe stats collection (1 day)
- Task 3: Transactional cache writes (0.5 days)
- Task 4: Architecture documentation (0.5 days)
- Task 5: Integration tests (2 days)

See [v3.5.1-ROADMAP.md](../project/v3.5.1-ROADMAP.md) for details.

## Acknowledgments

This release was made possible by the comprehensive PoC work in v3.4.0 that validated:
- 4.88x speedup with 3 workers
- 100% success rate
- Zero SQLite thread safety issues

The architectural insights from v3.4.0 led directly to the v3.5.0 simplification.
