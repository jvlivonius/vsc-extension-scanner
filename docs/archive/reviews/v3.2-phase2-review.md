✅ COMPLETED STEPS

1. Error Message Sanitization (2h)
   - Added sanitize_error_message() function
   - Updated all error handling to prevent information disclosure
   - Files: utils.py, vscan_api.py, extension_discovery.py

2. Extension Filtering with AND Logic (4h)
   - Added 4 CLI arguments: --include-ids, --exclude-ids, --publisher, --min-risk-level
   - Pre-scan and post-scan filtering
   - Reduces unnecessary API calls
   - Files: vscan.py

3. Improve Cache UX (3h)
   - Enhanced migration with progress indicators
   - Added average cache age and stale detection
   - Automatic recommendations (>50% stale → suggest refresh)
   - Files: cache_manager.py, vscan.py

4. Reduce Cache Database Overhead (3h)
   - Implemented context manager pattern
   - Expected 20-30% I/O reduction
   - Updated 3 most-called methods
   - Files: cache_manager.py

5. Configuration File Support (4h)
   - Added ~/.vscan/config.json support
   - 10 configurable options
   - Precedence: CLI > config > defaults
   - Files: vscan.py

6. Simplify Retry Logic (2h)
   - Added class constants for retry rules
   - Reduced code from 60 to 30 lines (50% reduction)
   - Single source of truth
   - Files: vscan_api.py

7. Simplify Logging Function (1h)
   - Reduced code from 41 to 26 lines (38% reduction)
   - Consolidated logic, removed duplication
   - Dictionary-based prefix lookup
   - Files: utils.py
