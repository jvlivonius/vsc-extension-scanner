---

## 🚨 Exit Codes

The tool returns standard exit codes for easy integration with scripts:

- **0** - Success, no vulnerabilities found
- **1** - Success, but vulnerabilities were found
- **2** - Scan failed due to an error

Example usage:
```bash
# 👇 Copy and run this command
vscan scan --quiet
if [ $? -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "Security issues detected!"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No extensions found"

Make sure VS Code is installed and you have extensions installed:
```bash
# 👇 Check if VS Code extensions directory exists
ls ~/.vscode/extensions/

# 👇 Specify custom directory if needed
vscan scan --extensions-dir /path/to/extensions
```

### Slow scans

Use caching to speed up repeated scans:
```bash
# 👇 First scan will be slower (API calls)
vscan scan

# 👇 Subsequent scans use cache (50x faster)
vscan scan

# 👇 Extend cache age to reduce API calls
vscan config set cache.max_age 30
```

### Rate limiting errors

The tool handles rate limiting automatically, but you can adjust:
```bash
# 👇 Increase delay between requests
vscan scan --delay 2.0

# 👇 Increase retry attempts
vscan scan --max-retries 5

# 👇 Increase retry delay
vscan scan --retry-delay 3.0
```

### No colors in terminal

Colors are automatically disabled in non-interactive environments. To force plain output:
```bash
# 👇 Copy and run this command
vscan scan --plain
```

### Cache issues

Clear the cache if you're seeing stale or incorrect data:
```bash
# 👇 Copy and run this command
vscan cache clear --force
```

## 🔬 Technical Details

### How It Works

1. **Discovery** - Automatically locates your VS Code extensions directory
2. **Analysis** - Queries vscan.dev API for security analysis of each extension
3. **Caching** - Stores results in SQLite database for fast repeated scans
4. **Reporting** - Formats results in your preferred output format

### Performance

**Real-world benchmark** (66 extensions scan):

| Mode | Time | Speed vs v3.4 | Speed vs Sequential |
|------|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Sequential (1 worker)** | 6 min 6s | 1.0x (baseline) | 1.0x |
| **Default (3 workers)** | 1 min 15s | **4.88x faster** | **4.88x faster** |
| **Maximum (5 workers)** | 1 min 26s | **4.27x faster** | **4.27x faster** |
| **Cached scan** | < 1 second | **366x faster** | **366x faster** |

**Per-extension performance:**
- **Default (3 workers):** ~0.3 seconds per extension
- **Sequential (1 worker):** ~1.5 seconds per extension
- **Maximum (5 workers):** ~0.35 seconds per extension
- **Cached:** Instant (< 0.01s per extension)

**Resource usage:**
- **Memory:** < 100MB RAM
- **Cache hit rate:** 70-90% (typical usage)
- **API calls saved:** 70-90% reduction after first scan

### Security Data Sources

**All security analysis is powered by [vscan.dev](https://vscan.dev)**, an excellent VS Code extension security analysis service.

This tool would not exist without vscan.dev's infrastructure. vscan.dev provides comprehensive analysis including:
- Extension source code and permissions review
- Third-party dependencies and known vulnerabilities detection
- Publisher reputation and verification status validation
- Network access patterns analysis
- File system permissions auditing
- Security scoring and risk level assessment

**We are deeply grateful to vscan.dev** for providing their public API, which makes this tool possible. This tool serves as a complementary CLI client to vscan.dev's analysis capabilities.

### Privacy

- ✅ No data is collected by this tool
- ✅ All analysis is performed by vscan.dev
- ✅ Cache is stored locally on your machine
- ✅ No credentials or secrets are transmitted

### API Usage & Respectful Practices

This tool implements multiple measures to minimize load on vscan.dev's infrastructure while providing excellent user experience:

**Rate Limiting**:
- Default 2.0s delay between API requests (configurable 1.0-5.0s)
- Prevents API overload and respects server resources
- Applied automatically across all worker threads

**Intelligent Caching**:
- 70-90% cache hit rate in typical usage
- 14-day default cache expiration (configurable)
- Reduces API calls by 70-90% after initial scan
- Makes repeated scans 50x faster (instant from cache)
- SQLite database with HMAC integrity protection

**Exponential Backoff Retry**:
- Maximum 3 retry attempts (configurable)
- Exponential delays: 2s → 4s → 8s with random jitter
- Prevents hammering API during temporary failures
- Graceful handling of network issues

**Thread-Safe Implementation**:
- 3 workers by default (configurable 1-5)
- Isolated API client per worker
- Thread-safe statistics collection
- Conservative parallelism respects rate limits

**Transparent Identification**:
- User-Agent: `VSCodeExtensionScanner/3.5.6 (+https://github.com/jvlivonius/vsc-extension-scanner)`
- Enables vscan.dev to identify and monitor tool usage
- Professional API etiquette

**Security**:
- HTTPS-only communication with certificate validation
- No circumvention of rate limits or access controls
- No attempt to bypass authentication (none required)

**Typical Impact**: Average user generates 100-200 API requests per month (vs 2,000+ without caching).

For complete details on ethical API usage, see [docs/project/ATTRIBUTION.md](docs/project/ATTRIBUTION.md).

### Platform Support

- ✅ macOS
- ✅ Windows
- ✅ Linux

The tool automatically detects your platform and finds the VS Code extensions directory.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Are verified publishers always safe?</strong></summary>

**A:** Verification confirms identity but doesn't guarantee security. A verified publisher means:
- ✅ Identity verified by marketplace
- ✅ Established track record
- ❌ Not a security audit

Always review the security analysis regardless of verification status.
</details>

### Technical Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: What data is collected about me?</strong></summary>

**A:** **None.** This tool:
- 🚫 Does not collect any user data
- 🚫 Does not send your extension list anywhere
- 🚫 Does not track usage or analytics
- ✅ Only queries vscan.dev API for public extension data
- ✅ Stores cache locally on your machine
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Why does the first scan take longer?</strong></summary>

**A:** The first scan makes API calls to vscan.dev for each extension. Subsequent scans use cached results (14-day default) which are instant.

**Performance:**
- First scan: 1-2 minutes (66 extensions)
- Cached scan: < 1 second (instant!)
- Cache hit rate: 70-90% typical
